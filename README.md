# TicTacToeJS
Web2 Assignment

For our first JavaScript assignment, we had to build two browser-based Tic-Tac-Toe games - one using object-oriented programming and another using functional programming.

Tic-tac-toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who place their symbol (X or O) in one of the available spaces on the grid. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins the game.

**Additional requirements:**

-   The two game versions must be indistinguishable to the player
-   The games must display a status message - either indicating the next player turn or the winner of the game
-   The games must have a restart button
-   You can only use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
-   No external libraries are allowed

There are no requirements for the styling of the games.
